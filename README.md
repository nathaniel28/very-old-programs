# very-old-programs

  I made these programs when I was very young. They are small programs, so I'm just dumping them all in this repository. I don't know if that's good practice or not. The most notable of the ones I made are not in the folder called 'bad_code'.

  I have spared the world of the worst of the programs. Turns out, when I was younger, I was a big fan of loop unrolling. So much, in fact, that instead of letting the compiler make this optimization, I would do it manually. Or perhaps I just didn't know how to use loops effectively.

  Anything found in bad_code I made when I was younger than 10, and is very, very bad code. I offer no explanation for anything found in that folder. Some of the names on the oldest of programs have been lost.
